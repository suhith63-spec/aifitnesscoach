                        IMPORTANT NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔥 CONSISTENCY IS KEY
The most perfect plan is useless without consistency. Show up, 
do the work, and trust the process.

⚠️ SAFETY FIRST
Always prioritize proper form over weight or speed. If something 
hurts (not muscle fatigue), stop and reassess.

📞 WHEN TO SEEK HELP
Consider working with a qualified trainer if you're unsure about 
exercise form or need additional guidance.

🎯 STAY FOCUSED
This plan is designed specifically for your goals and situation. 
Stick to it for at least 4-6 weeks before making major changes.
